# UI

- [x] mobile zooming then can't unzoom
- [x] draw all paths in svg, not just first path
- [x] scale vertical so you can see the bottom of draw area (or scroll?)
- [ ] show pen up/down buttons again
- [ ] show warning/error if drawing is out of bounds

# Hardware

- [ ] solenoid for lifting off the surface instead of servo
- [ ] barrel jack for motor power so it can be disconnected
